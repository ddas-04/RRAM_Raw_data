Fokker-Planck equation is 
(dp/dt)=-div.(C p)+D(grad)^2 p

Consider a barrier (1-F(x)), where F(x) is a Gaussian distribution.
In the convection term of FP eq., C=(d/dx)(1-F(x)).

Fokker-Planck equation is solved using FiPy package, to find the steady state of the p.
For the simulation some scale factors are used the term C and D.

Total probability is also calculated
